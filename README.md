## Gradle Setup

To get a Git project into your build:

* Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file Add it in your root build.gradle at the end
  of repositories:

```
allprojects {
  repositories {
      ...
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

* Step 2. Add the dependency

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.SmartToolFactory:Compose-Zoom:<version>'
}
```

## Modifier.zoom()

Modifier that zooms, pans, and rotates any Composable it set to. when [clip] is true
`Modifier.clipToBounds()` is used to limit content inside Composable bounds
`consume` param is for `Modifier.pointerInput` to consume current events to prevent other
gestures like scroll, drag or transform to initiate.
Callbacks notify user that gesture has started, going on finished with [ZoomData] that
contains current transformation information

```kotlin
fun Modifier.zoom(
    key: Any? = Unit,
    consume: Boolean = true,
    clip: Boolean = true,
    zoomState: ZoomState,
    onGestureStart: ((ZoomData) -> Unit)? = null,
    onGesture: ((ZoomData) -> Unit)? = null,
    onGestureEnd: ((ZoomData) -> Unit)? = null
)
```

### Parameters

* **key/key1-key2/keys** are used for restarting `Modifier.pointerInput(*keys)` and remember
  for getting `ZoomState`
* **consume** flag to prevent other gestures such as scroll, drag or transform to get
* **clip** when set to true clips to parent bounds. Anything outside parent bounds is not drawn
  empty space on sides or edges of parent.
* **zoomState** State of the zoom that contains option to set initial, min, max zoom, enabling
  rotation, pan or zoom and contains current [ZoomData]event propagations
* **onGestureStart** callback to to notify gesture has started and return current ZoomData of this
  modifier
* **onGesture** callback to notify about ongoing gesture and return current ZoomData of this
  modifier
* **onGestureEnd** callback to notify that gesture finished and return current ZoomData of this
  modifier

## ZoomState

Create and [remember] the [ZoomState] based on the currently appropriate transform configuration to
allow changing pan, zoom, and rotation.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun rememberZoomState(
    initialZoom: Float = 1f,
    initialRotation: Float = 0f,
    minZoom: Float = 1f,
    maxZoom: Float = 5f,
    zoomable: Boolean = true,
    pannable: Boolean = true,
    rotatable: Boolean = false,
    limitPan: Boolean = false,
    key1: Any? = Unit
): ZoomState {
    return remember(key1) {
        ZoomState(
            initialZoom = initialZoom,
            initialRotation = initialRotation,
            minZoom = minZoom,
            maxZoom = maxZoom,

            pannable = pannable,
            rotatable = rotatable,
            limitPan = limitPan
        )
    }
}
```

### Parameters

* **initialZoom** zoom set initially

## ZoomableImage

Zoomable image that zooms in and out in [ [minZoom], [maxZoom] ] interval and translates
zoomed image based on pointer position.
Double tap gestures reset image translation and zoom to default values with animation.
Callbacks notify user that gesture has started, going on finished with [ZoomData] that
contains current transformation information

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ZoomableImage(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    imageBitmap: ImageBitmap,
    alignment: Alignment = Alignment.Center,
    contentScale: ContentScale = ContentScale.Fit,
    contentDescription: String? = null,
    alpha: Float = DefaultAlpha,
    colorFilter: ColorFilter? = null,
    filterQuality: FilterQuality = DrawScope.DefaultFilterQuality,
    initialZoom: Float = 1f,
    minZoom: Float = 1f,
    maxZoom: Float = 5f,

  space on sides or edges of parent.
* **consume** flag to prevent other gestures such as scroll, drag or transform to get event
  propagations
* **zoomable** when set to true zoom is enabled
* **pannable** when set to true pan is enabled

## EnhancedZoomState

Create and [remember] the [EnhancedZoomState] based on the currently appropriate transform
configuration to allow changing pan, zoom, and rotation.
Allows to change zoom, pan, translate, or get current state by calling methods on this object. To be
hosted and passed to [Modifier.enhancedZoom].
Also contains [EnhancedZoomData] about current transformation area of Composable and visible are of
image being zoomed, rotated, or panned. If any animation is going on
current [EnhancedZoomState.isAnimationRunning] is true and [EnhancedZoomData] returns rectangle that
belongs to end of animation.

```kotlin
fun Modifier.enhancedZoom(
    key: Any? = Unit,
    clip: Boolean = true,
    enhancedZoomState: EnhancedZoomState,
    enabled: (Float, Offset, Float) -> Boolean = DefaultEnabled,
    zoomOnDoubleTap: (ZoomLevel) -> Float = enhancedZoomState.DefaultOnDoubleTap,
    onGestureStart: ((EnhancedZoomData) -> Unit)? = null,

    onGestureEnd: ((EnhancedZoomData) -> Unit)? = null,
)
```

### Parameters

* **initialZoom** zoom set initially
* **minZoom** minimum zoom value
* **maxZoom** maximum zoom value
* **fling** when set to true dragging pointer builds up velocity. When last pointer leaves
  Composable a movement invoked against friction till velocity drops below to threshold
* **moveToBounds** when set to true if image zoom is lower than initial zoom or panned out of image
  boundaries moves back to bounds with animation.
* **zoomable** when set to true zoom is enabled
* **pannable** when set to true pan is enabled
* **rotatable** when set to true rotation is enabled
* **limitPan** limits pan to bounds of parent Composable. Using this flag prevents creating empty
  space on sides or edges of parent

## EnhancedZoomableImage

Zoomable image that zooms in and out in [ [minZoom], [maxZoom] ] interval and pans zoomed image
based on pointer position. Double tap gestures reset image translation and zoom to default values
with animation. Difference between `ZoomaableImage` and `EnhancedZoomableImage` is this version
can animate back to bounds and have fling gesture that doesn't stop movement when last pointer
is up but continues motion agains friction.

`moveToBound` is true image moves to bounds when moved out of bounds. When
`fling` is set to true image moves until velocity drops below threshold.

```
@Composable
fun EnhancedZoomableImage(

## Modifier.animatedZoom()

Modifier that zooms in or out of Composable set to. This zoom modifier has option to move back to
bounds with an animation or option to have fling gesture when user removes from screen while
velocity is higher than threshold to have smooth touch effect.

Difference between `Modifier.enhancedZoom()` and `Modifier.animatedZoom()` is enhanced zoom
uses Bitmap dimensions and returns a callback that returns [EnhandedZoomData] that contains
visible image area which is suitable for crop while `Modifier.animatedZoom()` requires
dimensions of Composable to have valid pan limiting behavior. More suitable for zooming
Composables while enhanced zoom is more suitable for iamge zooming.

```kotlin
fun Modifier.animatedZoom(
    vararg keys: Any?,
    clip: Boolean = true,
    animatedZoomState: AnimatedZoomState,
    enabled: (Float, Offset, Float) -> Boolean = DefaultEnabled,
    zoomOnDoubleTap: (ZoomLevel) -> Float = animatedZoomState.DefaultOnDoubleTap,
)
```

### Parameters

* **clip** when set to true clips to parent bounds. Anything outside parent bounds is not drawn
* **animatedZoomState** State of the zoom that contains option to set initial, min, max zoom,
  enabling rotation, pan or zoom
* **zoomOnDoubleTap** lambda that returns current [ZoomLevel] and based on current level enables
  developer to define zoom on double tap gesture
* **enabled** lambda can be used selectively enable or disable pan and intercepting with scroll,
  drag or lists or pagers using current zoom, pan or rotation values

## AnimatedZoomState
